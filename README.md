# Summoner

Swift Media code test

## To run
Provide a Riot Developer API key as an environment variable `RG_API_KEY`.

### Notes
  - The API calls only fetch results for the North American region.
  - All times are in UTC
  - I thought of polling the API for new match data every minute, instead of updating when a summoner is searched, but didn't as I didn't want to hit the API's rate limit. Also, it wasn't specified in the test.
